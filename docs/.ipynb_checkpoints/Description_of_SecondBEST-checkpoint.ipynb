    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`SecondBEST` is a simplified implementation of the Bare Essentials for Surface Transfer (BEST) land surface model. The main simplifications are that `SecondBEST` does not incorporate the effects of vegetation, which reduces a lot of calculations within BEST. We also assume each grid cell is either fully bare soil or snow/ice, i.e, there are no fractional land types. The implementation here follows the description in [Pitman et al.](http://www.geo.utexas.edu/climate/Research/Reprints/Pitman.BMRC.1991.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a ready reference to the equations used in `SecondBEST` so that interested users don't have to read the above reference if they don't wish to. However, if you plan on making heavy use of `SecondBEST`, you are encouraged to do so!"
